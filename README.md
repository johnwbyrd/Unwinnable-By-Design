# Unwinnable By Design

This is a very early concept prototype of a text adventure game, written in the style of Steve Meretzky and Douglas Adams.

The game is being written with [Inform 7 version 10.1.2](https://github.com/ganelson/inform/releases/tag/v10.1.2), and it requires a number of Inform extensions that were sourced from [Inform 7 Extensions version 10.1](https://github.com/i7/extensions).
