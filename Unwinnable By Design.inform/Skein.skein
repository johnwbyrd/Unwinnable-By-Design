    <result xml:space="preserve">Wonderful, you kill the NPC. The NPC is now completely dead. I guess you're expecting some sort of in-game reward, like some sort of clever death dialogue, or maybe your score will go up. Look at you, going through this video game, committing a random act of violence upon a helpless NPC. Look at what your video game addiction has done to you. It's made you into a violent random killer. Whatever. The NPC is now completely dead, and it's all your fault.&#x000A;And that NPC also is carrying a quest, which you can't actually accomplish anymore, because the NPC is dead, so you might as well reload the game at this point. Or not, see if I care.&#x000A;&#x000A;[Your score has just gone down by one point.]&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

I intended to make a puzzle here, where you had to say some sort of password like "xyzzy" to the NPC, but I never got around to implementing it, so there's this bug you can exploit, where you can just whatever the NPC is holding without asking permission first. I will get around to patching this bug in the next release of this game.&#x000A;&#x000A;That's abstract!&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
